      <p class="text-start">
        In the late 1970s, as the United States was entering a new era of
        retail, a visionary entrepreneur named Samuel Hudson embarked on a
        journey to redefine the shopping experience. With a passion for
        innovation and a commitment to customer satisfaction, he conceptualized
        the idea of a superstore that would offer everything a consumer could
        desire under one roof. Little did he know that this dream would evolve
        into the iconic Cloud 9 Superstore.
